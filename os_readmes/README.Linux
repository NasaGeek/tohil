# install python3 dev and python3 pip installer, then
# use pip to install the hypothesis testing framework,
# which tohil needs for its tests:
#
# sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
# sudo pip3 install hypothesis
#
# say you build your own python in /opt/local...
# ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --with-python-version=3.9
#

autoreconf
./configure --with-python-version=3.7m
