****************************
  What's New In Tohil 4.1
****************************

==================================
tclobjs returned from more places
==================================

* `to=dict` conversions now returns tclobjs for the values
* tclobj.as_dict() does so as well

==================================
Python-side function registration
==================================

register_callback

============================
several other improvements
============================

* Pass None from Tcl to Python functions called via tohil::call
  by using the tohil::NONE sentinel.

* More precise error messages when Tohil startup fails should help
  with troubleshooting installation problems.

* Lots of new tests.

============================
numerous bug fixes
============================

* Python builtins can be called from Tcl-side tohil::call without
  resorting to explicitly specifying the builtins namespace.

* Fixed bugs in how tclvars (tclobjs bound to vars) handled some methods,
  such as insert, pop, append, and extend.

* Correct behavior of tclobj iterators, also fixes a crash.

* If Python is initializing Tcl, it now does so using
  `package require` rather than a `Tohil_Init` to cause Tohil's Tcl package
  code to get sourced.




====================================
considerably improved documentation
====================================

We've considerably improved and extended the Tohil tutorial and
reference, in Python-standard RST format,
and are serving it out at https://flightaware.github.io/tohil-docs/
